        <span><strong>The uprising of Mzamomtsha</strong></span>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Mzamomtsha Primary</strong> was a fresh start for the community and their 
                school building project created by <em>SAOTA</em>. this was a part of a school
                 building that focused on the marginalized area affected by the Apartheid, this
                 involved rapid urbanization and urban migration.With all these sudden changes
                 occuring; the opportunity to grow the area was taken.A school was built, town 
                 hall, civic centre sports centre, social and economic growth/opportunities.</p><br><br>
            <p>The small town that Mzamomtsha Primary belongs to, grew and was split in 3 sections:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A section belongs to the children</strong></li>
                    <li>A section belongs to those that belongs to the community
                        and what the community can stake claim to.</li>
                    <li>The last section was comprised of public facilities such as 
                        the sport centres(A physical training slab), bascet ball corts and a liabrary
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 255, 85)">The buildings represents the adult and
            the outside world and has a confident, sophisticated language direct counter to the "twee".
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 191)">The basis around the once normal urban school, 
            changed so much over the years that urbanisation took place in a way that provided the surrounding areas 
            with joibs in building to build new facilitis for the growth of the town itself.
